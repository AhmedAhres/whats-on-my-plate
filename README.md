# What's on my plate?
Analyzing the food impact on the environment and the nutrition score label.

# Abstract
We are what we eat and the food system drives everything. Nowadays, there are endless range of products being sold in all over the world differing from one country to another. In this sense, different countries have a different impact on their population and on the environment depending on the products being sold and produced.
The aim of this project is to analyze how these products can have an impact on the daily life of their consumers in terms of healthiness, eco-friendliness as well as production. 

Our goal is to understand and explain how the food industry works and how it can influence other aspects such as the environment and the population eating habits.
In order to accomplish our goal, we will be used a large data-set providing extensive information about a large number of products being sold in supermarkets worldwide.


# Research questions
We will guide our work with the following questions:

- What is the proportion of imported/exported products per country?
- Which countries sell the highest variety of eco-friendly products in terms of packaging and CO2 footprint?
- Which countries have the largest variety of organic-labeled products?
- What is the average nutrition score of every product category?
- What ingredients imply a better nutrition score (or vice-versa)?

# Dataset
In order to answer these research questions, we will be looking at the ***Open Food Facts*** database. This dataset provides us with information about the ingredients, category, nutrition score, countries where sold and produced for every product in the supermarkets worldwide. For example, by analyzing where a certain product is produced and sold, we can answer questions regarding trading between the different countries. 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Understand how to deal with large amount of data (1.7 GB)
- Understand the structure of the ***Open Food Facts*** features and labels, and explore its data.
- Think about what would be the best manner to visualize the results of the research questions
- Data cleaning and data analysis of the research questions
- Interpreting the preliminary results, and draw hypothesis of why it is the case.
- Comment and debug the code
- Set up our goals and plans for the next milestone.


# Timeline of the progress:

## November 4th:
    - Download the Open Food Facts data
    - Figure out how to access and manipulate the ADA cluster
    - Set up the Github repository and skeleton of our project (Jupyter notebook or Spark Cluster)
    - Skim over the structure of the data provided by openfoodfacts.org and the official description on their website
    - Come up with research questions related to our data set of choice


## November 11th:
    - Cleaning the openfoodfacts dataset i.e., deleting the unnecessary columns for out research questions and replacing NaN

## November 18th: 
    - Explore the data available after the cleaning, and analyse the data related to our research questions
    - Interpreting the preliminary results, and draw hypothesis related to our research questions.

## November 25th:
    - Decide on the focus of our projects from the different research question and analysis of the data done so far.
    - Clean, Comment and debug the code for submission
    - Set up our goals and plans for the next milestone.

## December 2nd:
    - Search for data from other external source that may enhance/confirm our project story and research questions.
    - Explore the possibility to generate more data from the data that we already have linked to our research question.
    - Explore the possibility to predict some features that are missing in our data.
    - Drafting the outline for our report/data story
    - Continiously enhancing our data exploration/analysis/cleaning.
## December 9th:
    - Continuously enhancing our data exploration/analysis/cleaning.
    - Finalizing the report/data story.
    - Start working on the poster and presentation.


# Options to consider:
Enhance our data with more external sources of data.

# Questions for TAs
- If we use a small portion data from another data-set, should we also reference it? If so, how?
