<p>Analyzing the food impact on the environment and the nutrition score label.</p>

<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We are what we eat and the food system drives everything. Nowadays, there are endless range of products being sold in all over the world differing from one country to another. In this sense, different countries have a different impact on their population and on the environment depending on the products being sold and produced.
The aim of this project is to analyze how these products can have an impact on the daily life of their consumers in terms of healthiness, eco-friendliness as well as production.</p>

<p>Our goal is to understand and explain how the food industry works and how it can influence other aspects such as the environment and the population eating habits.
In order to accomplish our goal, we will be used a large data-set providing extensive information about a large number of products being sold in supermarkets worldwide.</p>

<h1 id="data-story">Data Story</h1>
<p>The data story can be found in https://ahmedahres.github.io/whats-on-my-plate/</p>

<h1 id="research-questions">Research questions</h1>
<p>We will guide our work with the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the proportion of imported/exported products per country?</li>
  <li>Which countries sell the highest variety of eco-friendly products in terms of packaging?</li>
  <li>Which countries have the largest variety of organic-labeled products?</li>
  <li>What is the average nutrition score of every product category?</li>
  <li>What nutrition-related features imply a better nutrition score (or vice-versa)?</li>
  <li>Given the product and assuming that the ingredients are known, what is the expected nutrition score?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="datasets">Datasets</h1>
<p>In order to answer these research questions, we will be looking at the <strong><em>Open Food Facts</em></strong> database. This dataset provides us with information about the ingredients, category, nutrition score, countries where sold and produced for every product in the supermarkets worldwide. For example, by analyzing where a certain product is produced and sold, we can answer questions regarding trading between the different countries. Moreover, we will be using the data-set containing for the geographical position of the center of each country. The data-set was taken from the following link: https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv?fbclid=IwAR11sd1ArI7yBbHAJvsvNCUmOaxdwf__o5bd1w8RepWD47NrVO30vN8Ka_0</p>
